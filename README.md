Software to run drones

Ok so this is the repository where Swarmtech Software Squad members, Andy G-Unit and radman5 will be developing a mission planner application to be used to plan flight paths for swarming quadcopter drones.  We are 3rd year students at Otago Polytechnic in New Zealand.  This is our 3rd year project where we are using swarming drones to replace high cost helicopter usage in the search and rescue field.  Feel free to have a look around and leave comments and whatever. 

Peace homies! ;)
